## PROJECT TITLE:-
**PG LIFE WEBPAGE**

## PROJECT DESCRIPTION
* PG Life is a Full-Stack Web Application. I was given this project to complete as part of my training for a course in full-stack web development at Internshala. After receiving the advice, I developed this web application using my understanding, knowledge, and experience. It is tailored, in my opinion, to what would be better functions in this software from the user's standpoint of the user.
* The web application functions flawlessly on all devices and is entirely responsive.
* Skills Used:- HTML, CSS, Bootstrap 5, Javascript, PHP, MySQL
